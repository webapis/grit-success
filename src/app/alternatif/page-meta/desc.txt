in google keyword planner made research for keywords that was used to search for but with lower results. for example "sefamerve büyük beden elbise" search term is used 10k times each month with lower result. search returns plus size dresses from sefamerve and a few other options. I have aggregated to websites that sell online plus size dresses for woman and created a page that displays list of websites and links to relavant pages with plus sizes. And also dis plays additional information like average price, starting anding price range. sample image of a dress.  I need to create relavant description, keywords, page title, header meta informations so that my page will rank hight to  "sefamerve büyük beden elbise"  search result. here is my object that will contain meta data: {     "title": "sefamerve büyük beden elbise alternatifleri",     "description": "",     "keywords": "",     "header":"Büyük Beden Elbise Alternatifleri" } change it as requred
